#in python we use input funtion to recieve input from user
idol = input('who is your idol ? ') 
print("so "+idol +" is your idol great.")

# Learned an intresting thing if you will run the same code on python2
# It will give some error as in python2 input funtion wouln't use to change input it takes to strings where as python3 does.
